After initiating a model, this function will return an mean accuracy score following 5 folds of cross validation - this is to ensure that we are getting a smoothed out representation of both the training and test sets. Next this function will provide us with the Confusion Matrix; how many correct vs incorrect classifications have actually taken place within the given model?

This space under the curve is known as the AUC, and therefore a larger AUC space is indicative of a better model. For this Random Forest Classifier model, the graph therefore indicates very strong model performance (hoo-rah)!\n",

        "Started with an unstructured table of 23,000 clothing text reviews and corresponding Recommend vs Not Recommend classifications.\n",
        "Taken the text reviews, cleaned them and built them into a matrix\n",
        "Briefly explored the data before applying initial Machine Learning Algorithms\n",
        "Balanced the unvenly weighted target variables before re-running the same Algorithms with improved findings\n",
        "Identified the best performing model (Random Forest Classifier), explored it's most important features and computed further Precision/Recall metrics (including ROC-AUC).\n",
        "Achieved a final accuracy score above 90% on the model's training dataset, and an ROC-AUC score above 99%.\n",
        "I've enjoyed working with this dataset and have learned heaps around using text data to predict an outcome - given this has been my first exposure to working with text, the buzz in being able to do just this has been great! It has also been an enjoyable experience using this data to predict genuinely meaningful and useful insights, such as knowing what consumers are looking for in a clothing product, and what matters most to them.\n",

        "In terms of how this kernel could be extended or improved, we could:\n",
        "\n",
        "Take a more rigorous approach to mining the text data, such as categorising products, controlling for spelling errors / using more advanced modelling techniques such as topic modelling\n",
        "Make better use of the Polarity metric within Machine Learning\n",
        "Apply a more extensive list of algorithms (including Deep Learning) to the text data\n",
        "Apply GridSearchCV or RandomisedSearchCV to optimise the final model\n",
        "Create an ensemble of models for better prediction\n",
        "Perhaps I will return to some or all of these points at a later date :). For now however, thank you for reading this kernel! Please do feel free to share with me your thoughts, feedback and any suggestions for improvement - I am always willing to learn new or more efficient techniques! Cheers.\n",
